# Avida-RS

A faithful Rust implementation of the Avida artificial life digital evolution platform with an egui-based graphical interface.

## üß¨ What is Avida?

Avida is a software platform for research in digital evolution where self-replicating computer programs (digital organisms) evolve within a user-defined computational environment. Originally developed at Caltech and Michigan State University, Avida has been used in hundreds of scientific publications studying evolution, complexity, and emergence.

## ‚ú® Features

- **Complete Avida Instruction Set**: All 26 instructions (a-z) from the original Avida
- **Virtual CPU**: 3 registers, 2 stacks, 4 heads (IP, Read, Write, Flow)
- **Self-Replication**: Organisms copy their genome and produce offspring with mutations
- **60√ó60 Toroidal World**: Wraparound grid topology
- **Task System**: 9 logic operations (NOT, NAND, AND, ORN, OR, ANDN, NOR, XOR, EQU)
- **Merit-Based Selection**: CPU cycles allocated proportionally to task performance
- **Mutation System**: Copy mutations (0.0025), insertions (0.05), deletions (0.05)
- **Real-Time Visualization**: Watch evolution unfold in real-time
- **Interactive Inspector**: Click organisms to view their genome, CPU state, and tasks
- **Configurable Parameters**: Adjust mutation rates and simulation speed

## üöÄ Quick Start

### Prerequisites

- Rust (latest stable version)
- Cargo (comes with Rust)

### Building

```bash
cargo build --release
```

### Running

```bash
cargo run --release
```

## üéÆ Using the Simulator

### Controls

- **‚ñ∂ Play / ‚è∏ Pause**: Start/stop the simulation
- **Speed Slider**: Control updates per frame (1-100)
- **Reset**: Clear world and inject new ancestor
- **Click on cells**: Inspect individual organisms

### Display Modes

- **Age**: Color by organism age (purple ‚Üí red)
- **Merit**: Color by task performance (yellow)
- **Genome Size**: Red = larger, Blue = smaller than ancestor
- **Tasks Completed**: Green intensity = number of tasks

### Statistics Panel

- Population size and births/deaths
- Average genome size and merit
- Mutation rate controls
- Task completion counts

### Inspector Panel

- Organism position and generation
- Complete genome sequence
- CPU state (registers, heads)
- Tasks completed

## üß¨ The Default Ancestor

The simulation starts with the hand-designed ancestor organism:

```
wzcagcccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccczvfcaxgab
```

This 50-instruction genome is capable of self-replication. Most instructions are `c` (nop-C), serving as a mutation buffer and allowing evolution to explore new functionality.

## üìä How Evolution Works

1. **Replication**: Organisms execute instructions from their circular genome
2. **Self-Copy**: Using h-alloc, h-search, h-copy, and h-divide instructions
3. **Mutations**: Random changes during copying and division
4. **Tasks**: Organisms perform logic operations to gain merit
5. **Selection**: Higher merit = more CPU cycles = faster reproduction
6. **Evolution**: Beneficial mutations spread through the population

## üî¨ Task System

Organisms gain merit bonuses by performing logic operations:

| Task | Operation | Merit Multiplier |
|------|-----------|------------------|
| NOT  | !B        | 2√ó (2^1.0)      |
| NAND | !(A & B)  | 2√ó (2^1.0)      |
| AND  | A & B     | 4√ó (2^2.0)      |
| ORN  | A \| !B   | 4√ó (2^2.0)      |
| OR   | A \| B    | 8√ó (2^3.0)      |
| ANDN | A & !B    | 8√ó (2^3.0)      |
| NOR  | !(A \| B) | 16√ó (2^4.0)     |
| XOR  | A ^ B     | 16√ó (2^4.0)     |
| EQU  | !(A ^ B)  | 16√ó (2^4.0)     |

Tasks are detected through the `IO` instruction (q), which outputs values and receives inputs.

## üèóÔ∏è Architecture

### Core Modules

- **instruction.rs**: 26-instruction enum with parsing
- **cpu.rs**: Virtual CPU with registers, stacks, and heads
- **organism.rs**: Organism structure with genome and state
- **execute.rs**: Instruction execution engine
- **tasks.rs**: Task detection and merit rewards
- **world.rs**: 60√ó60 toroidal grid and update scheduler
- **ui.rs**: egui-based visualization and controls

### Key Concepts

- **Circular Genome**: Instructions wrap around (IP % genome_size)
- **Template Matching**: Nop complements used for h-search
  - nop-A ‚Üî nop-B
  - nop-B ‚Üî nop-C
  - nop-C ‚Üî nop-A
- **Merit System**: CPU cycles ‚àù merit / total_merit
- **Toroidal Topology**: Edges wrap (organisms born at neighbors)

- **Deletion**: 0.05 (per position at division)

### World Parameters

- **Grid Size**: 60√ó60 (3,600 max organisms)

## üîç What to Watch For

As the simulation runs, you may observe:

1. **Population Growth**: Ancestor replicates and fills the world
2. **Genome Size Changes**: Mutations cause length variation
3. **Task Evolution**: Organisms evolve logic operations
4. **Merit Increase**: Average merit rises as tasks are discovered
5. **Diversity**: Different lineages with varying genomes
6. **Parasites**: Organisms that copy from neighbors (sometimes)
