# Repository Guidance

- Keep documentation concise and focused on actionable information for contributors and users.
- Prefer placing planning material in issues or project boards rather than long-form markdown files.
- When updating markdown, provide clear section headings and limit emoji usage to occasional highlights.
- Non-code assets (markdown, images) live at the repository root unless a dedicated `docs/` folder becomes necessary.
